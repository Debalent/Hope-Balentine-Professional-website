HEADSHOT PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FILE REQUIRED: headshot.jpg

STEPS:
1. Use a professional, high-quality headshot photo.
2. Name the file exactly: headshot.jpg
3. Place it in this folder: /assets/images/
   → Full path: Hope-Balentine-Professional-website/assets/images/headshot.jpg

4. Delete this HEADSHOT-INSTRUCTIONS.txt after placing the image.

PHOTO SPECIFICATIONS (recommended):
  - Format: JPG or WebP
  - Dimensions: 760×760px minimum (square or portrait crop)
  - Object position: Centered on face, shoulders visible
  - Background: Neutral — cream, white, soft gray, or deep navy
  - Lighting: Professional lighting, warm tone preferred
  - Attire: Executive business professional

OG (SOCIAL PREVIEW) IMAGE:
  Also place a social preview image:
    File: og-preview.jpg
    Location: /assets/images/og-preview.jpg
    Dimensions: 1200×630px (standard Open Graph size)
    Content: Name, title, and headshot overlaid on navy background

FALLBACK BEHAVIOR:
  If headshot.jpg is missing or fails to load, the site will
  automatically display a stylized "HB" monogram placeholder
  in Deep Navy with Soft Gold letters. The site will still
  look polished without the photo.
